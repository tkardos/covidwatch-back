# CovidWatch -- The app

## What is CovidWatch?

CovidWatch is an app that uses externally sourced Covid19 information and calculates some country-specific data concerning the number cases. The data is sent to a client where it is represented visually on charts in an easily comprihesible way. An interesting feature of our app is that it also connected to a series of LED ligths controlled by an external program, and the data calculated by the CovidWatch app is visualized on these lights.

## The aim of CovidWatch

The main reason for creatinf CovidWatch is to represent Covid-related, country-specific data in an easily accessible manner. Our calculations are based on just a couple of variables, thus the data represented by us is not meant for scientific use, rather it meant for public use.
